Quiz Question:

In this week's quiz (the final quiz in CPS109 - well done on getting here!), we will be using a few of the concepts learned today to solve a given problem.

Write a program that takes in user input. The user input should be a series of integers, and for each integer entered add it to a list. 
If they did not enter an integer, catch the error then prompt them to do so and keep asking. (With one exception, as described below)

If they enter just the Enter key, then close that list. If they enter an integer, then get them to populate a new list. If they enter the Enter key twice in a row, however, then finish prompting the user for input.
Once the user has finished entering their inputs (indicated by two Enter presses back-to-back), create a greater list that contains the lists of integers that the user has entered, in order.

Then, select a value randomly from the odd-numbered indices in the even-numbered (by index) lists, and multiply all even-numbered indices in the odd-numbered lists by that random value. Print the value selected.

Print the modified list of lists.


Example Input/Output:
Input:
>>> Enter an integer: 1
>>> Enter an integer: no I don't think I will
Please enter a valid integer
>>> Enter an integer: 2
>>> Enter an integer: 2.5
Please enter a valid integer
>>> Enter an integer: 3
>>> Enter an integer: 
>>> Enter an integer: 4
>>> Enter an integer: 5
>>> Enter an integer: 6
>>> Enter an integer: 7
>>> Enter an integer: 
>>> Enter an integer: 4.25
Please enter a valid integer
>>> Enter an integer: 8
>>> Enter an integer: 9
>>> Enter an integer: 10
>>> Enter an integer: 11
>>> Enter an integer: 
>>> Enter an integer: 12
>>> Enter an integer: 
>>> Enter an integer: 

# Our list would look like: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10, 11], [12]]
# The random value would be selected from: [2, 9, 11] (let's assume 11 was selected randomly)

Output:
The random number selected was: 11
[[1, 2, 3], [44, 5, 66, 7], [8, 9, 10, 11], [132]]
