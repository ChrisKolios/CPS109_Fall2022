Quiz Question:

Note: This week’s quiz will be a shorter one due to running through the Ubuntu systems in preparation for the midterm at the beginning of the lab.

Factorial, schmacktorial. Who cares about some boring old mathematical concept? You’re cutting-edge Python coders, so you should be coding cutting-edge mathematical concepts!

Introducing: The Snacktorial. The key limitation of the factorial is its inability to handle decimals. The Snacktorial resolves this. Here are the rules for the Snacktorial:

If the input is negative or 0, the Snacktorial is 0
If the input is greater than 0 but less than or equal to 1, the Snacktorial is just the input
If the input is greater than 1, the Snacktorial is equal to the input times the Snacktorial of the input minus 1

So for example the Snacktorial of 4.5 is 4.5 * 3.5 * 2.5 * 1.5 * 0.5 = 29.53125

Your goal is to implement a recursive function that calculates the Snacktorial of some float input

Example Input/Output:
Input:
>>> Enter the number you’d like the Snacktorial of: 2.5
Output:
1.875

Input:
>>> Enter the number you’d like the Snacktorial of: 3.14159
Output:
1.0874982674320444

Input:
>>> Enter the number you’d like the Snacktorial of: 4
Output:
24.0

Input:
>>> Enter the number you’d like the Snacktorial of: -3.3
Output:
0
