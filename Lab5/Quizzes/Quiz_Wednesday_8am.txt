Quiz Question: The Peculiar Product’s Base Case Bonanza

Consider a recursive function “OddBonanza” that takes as an input argument a list of odd integers, and returns an odd integer consisting of the special product as defined below.

Consider the following recursive function definition:
If there is nothing in the list then return 0
If there is only one number in the list then:
If the number ends in 1 return 9 (and vice versa)
If the number ends in 3 return 7 (and vice versa)
If the number ends in 5 return 5
Otherwise, return the product of the OddBonanza of the first half of the list and the OddBonanza of the second half of the list. Note that in the case of a list with an odd length, let the first half take the extra element.

Implement this function as described (recursively).

Example Input/Output:
Input: 
list_to_bonanzafy = [1, 3, 5]
Output:
315

Input: 
list_to_bonanzafy = [31, 243, 1255]
Output:
315

Input: 
list_to_bonanzafy = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
Output:
945

Input:
list_to_bonanzafy = [1, 9, 25, 49, 81, 905]
Output:
2025
