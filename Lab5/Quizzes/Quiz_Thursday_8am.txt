Quiz Question: Recursive AndOr Flip

Consider a recursive function “RecursiveAndOrFlip” that takes as an input argument a list of booleans, and returns a single boolean as per the behavior defined below.

Consider the following recursive function definition:
    If there is nothing in the list then return False
    If there is only one boolean in the list then:
      If the boolean is True return False
      If the boolean is False return True
    Otherwise,
        If the length of the list is odd, return the “and” operator of RecursiveAndOrFlip of the first half of the list and RecursiveAndOrFlip of the second half of the list. 
        If the length of the list is even, return the “or” operator of RecursiveAndOrFlip of the first half of the list and RecursiveAndOrFlip of the second half of the list.

  Note that in the case of a list with an odd length, let the first half take the extra element.

Implement this function as described (recursively), and call it on some inputs.

Example Input/Output:
Input: 
bool_list = [True, False]
Output:
True

Input: 
bool_list = [True, False, False]    # Consider after flips is: [False, True, True]
# [False or True] and True -> True (Correct)
# False and [True or True] -> False (Incorrect)
Output:
True

Input: 
bool_list = [False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True, True]
Output:
False
