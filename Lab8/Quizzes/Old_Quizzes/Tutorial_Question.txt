The following are the requirements for a program. You are to
write the skeleton of the program and design tests for it. Do not
write any further code than what a skeleton program would require
and the test syntax.

Design a program that keeps track of animals at a vet. Generally,
pets will have names, chip IDs, owner(s), addresses, etc. They will
also have had at least one procedure or check up in order to be kept
track of at the vet. The program needs to be able to update animal
information as need be.

*** Optional Bonus Question (NOT for marks - only do for interest if time!) ***

Finally, the threat has been vanquished. Thanks to being able to decode their attack
message in the last bonus problem, you anticipated the exact time of their strike,
and the Teletubbies are no more. Shrek gave you a nice long hug for making his swamp
a peaceful place again. However, you've heard the rumblings of a secret Teletubby 
society that lives in the sewers with the Teenage Mutant Recursion Turtles, and so as
one who is intimate with Teletubbies, you are tasked with creating a program that 
describes the various attributes of a Teletubby. You must prepare the future 
generation of CPS109 students, lest they rise again!

The following are the requirements for a program. You are to
write the skeleton of the program and design tests for it. Do not
write any further code than what a skeleton program would require
and the test syntax.

Design a program skeleton that contains all important information about Teletubbies, 
as well as some of the useful methods that you have used to defeat them in the past. 
Generally, Teletubbies will have: names, colours, leaders, roles, and TVs.
Note that TVs are themselves a class, which contain the attributes: size, channel,
and communication_password. You should have 2 class methods that change a Teletubby's
name and role, and 1 class method that can change a TV's channel. For helper methods,
you should add a method that exorcises a Teletubby, one that zaps a Teletubby with
the Teletubby Demagnetizer 3000, and one that hugs a Teletubby (with a force of over 
9000 Newtons)!
